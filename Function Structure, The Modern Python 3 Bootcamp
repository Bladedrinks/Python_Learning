Without typing the parenthese (), you can't invoke the program written in IDE from the command line.

Defining a function does nothing but "providing a definition to a a functoin,"; that means you can't 
run the code by simply defining a function, which is just a definition, rather than an imperative.

"paren" is the abbrevation of "parenthesis".
"parens" is its plural form, pronounced like "pah-ren-ts".
The 's' letter at the end of word has the same pronunciation as the 's' in the word "happens".

When a car gets bogged down in the mud, it is stuck or sinks in the wet ground and can not get
out of the mud by itself.

When people get bogged down in details, they don't make any progress simply because some 
problems with the details have not been fixed.

The phrase "bog down" might be pronounced like "bogown" where the "d" sound has been
assimilated into the preceding "g" sound. This is called "assimilation" in phonology.
