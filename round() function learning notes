This file explains why round(number, None) and round(number, 0) return different values - one is an integer
and the other is a floating number which is equal to that integer if removed the fractional part.

The following lines are an example illustrating the "weird" phenomenon mentioned above:
>>> round(2.3, 0)
2.0
>>> round(2.3)
2

Without thinking deeply, round(2.3) and round(2.3, 0) should be considered as returning the same value since both round(2.3)
and round(2.3, 0) make the number of 2.3 rounded to zero decimals (or to zero decimal digits, or to the nearest ones, or the 
nearest integer), which is 2 .

Let's start with 'round(2.3, 0)'.

In this case, the 'number' parameter is 2.3 and the optional 'ndigits' parameter is 0 .

By the definition of the built-in round() function, we know that "(the) value (of the 'number' parameter) should be rounded to
the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus 'ndigits'."

In round(2.3, 0), we've passed in 0 as the 'ndigits' parameter, so 10 to the power minus 'ndigits' is equal to 10^(-0) which 
can also be viewed as 1/10^0 . Since in Python any number that is the result of the division operation is a float, 10^(-0) =
1/10^0 = 1 / 1 = 1.0 

Now based on 1.0, we can find some multiples of 1.0 that are close to the given value/number of 2.3, which include (but not 
only include), 1.0(=1 * 1.0), 2.0(=2 * 1.0), 3.0(=3 * 1.0), 4.0(=4 * 1.0), etc. (b is a multiple of a if and only if b = n * a
and n is an integer. Say, -9.9 is a multiple of 3.3 simply because -9.9 equals the integer of -3 times 3.3, even though 3.3 is
not an integer.) 

Among these multiples of 10 to the power minus 'ndigits', the one that is closest to 2.3 is 2.0 since |2.0 - 2.3| < |1.0 - 2.3| 
< |3.0 - 2.3| < |4.0 - 2.3| .

Then, let's talk about 'round(2.3)' .

The definition of the round() function tells us, "If 'ndigits' is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to its
input." Therefore, what 'round(2.3) is gonna be returning is an integer, rather than other types of data. It can be either 1 or
2 or 3 or 4 which are all integers close to 2.3. Among them, the nearest one is obviously 2 .
