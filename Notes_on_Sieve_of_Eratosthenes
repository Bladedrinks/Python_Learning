In this file, we comment on the pseudocode of the sieve of Eratosthenes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

Here's the pseudocode and our comments on it:

Input: an integer n > 1.
 
 Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n, 
 initially all set to true.
  # MY COMMENTS: In Python, it's impossible to index a list starting from 2. 
 
 for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding âˆšn:
   if A[i] is true:
     for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i, ..., not exceeding n:
       A[j] := false.
 
 Output: all i such that A[i] is true.
